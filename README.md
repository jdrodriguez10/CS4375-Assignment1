## CS 4375 Assignment 1 part 3

The goal for this assingment is to write a simple C program that uses fork()
and then calls some form of exec() to runs another C program
(printMyName.c). Try at least two variants of exec() from execle(), execlp(), execv(), and execvp().

## Compile and Run:
1. Inside the directory type make to compile the files.

2. Next run ./forkexecv or ./forkexecl to run one of the programs.

3. After using the programs type make clean to remove .o files.
